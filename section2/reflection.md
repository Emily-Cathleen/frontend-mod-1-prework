## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
  * I wait too long. I have noticed that this can be to my detriment when I need something clarified for me to grasp a concept.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
  * I grasped 95% of the exercises. I am the most proud of myself for crushing the Function section and using those outside resources. I am actually in need of the clarification of running a file in node. I need help with this. I used repl.it to run all of my code. I messaged a cohort friend today to compare notes and confirm that I am doing it correctly.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  * Conditional statements use boolean logic and evaluate to true or false. Am I hungry ? True or false.
  * Websites that only allow you to view content or book a trip if you are old enough. So if I want to rent a car, a website would use a conditional statement to determine if I am "25 years of age or older". If I am under 25, I cannot rent a car. If I am 25 or older, I can rent a car.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
  * if (condition1) {
    } else if(condition2){
    } else if(condition 3)
    else ()

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

Conditional statements, comparison Operators logical operators, If statements, if/else statements.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
  * I am struggling with building the logic with else/if statements, I cant identify a specific question, I need more practice.
