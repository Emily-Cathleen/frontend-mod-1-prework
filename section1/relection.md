## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

  * I loved this article! The POM breaks were very helpful for me.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
  * string: Text
  * Integer: a number. Could be negative, positive, or decimal.
  * Array: ["a", "list", "of", "items"]
  * Boolean: true or false


3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log(`Hello world!`);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

//   This allows you to make notes in your work without them affecting the code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is the name of a storage location. You assign value to variables.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

On AirBNB, three variables that are used are the location input, the budget constraints, and the time available to travel. Same with an Airline such as SouthWest.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

To add or combine two things togeter.
EX:
var firstName = "emily";
var lastName = "corcoran";
console.log(" My name is " + firstName + " " + lastName );

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
To combine first and last names.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I have questions about splitting an array up if I want to print it to the console. If I wanted to isolate one value from an array and use it to concatonate or interpolate a function.
