## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  * "Having a growth mindset is associated with more mastery and learning oriented behaviors, which can be applied to developing programming skills. Growth-minded individuals may be more apt to practice more often, persevere in the face of difficulty, and accept critical feedback." - this resonated with me, because in recent years, I tend to learn a new skill and then take a week off before practicing again. What I have been doing is NOT a growth mindset. It is a fear based mindset. I think that reframing this and practicing a little everyday on a schedule, is my key to success before Mod1.
  * This is a practice and something that CAN be adapted to and learned.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  * I am practicing everyday.
  * I get tired easily towards the end of a section with the pre-work. I need to take more Pom breaks and not longer breaks like I have been doing this week.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
  * Instagram probably uses arrays to store pictures!

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
  * An array is a single variable that can hold multiple values/variables. It doesnt just sore one value, it stores a list of related values.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  * A Loop repeats an action a # of times. This used in conjunction with array allows you to iterate over a list of items and apply the same action to a list of items.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
  * We can write "I love dogs" 5 separate times. Or, I can use a loop to write "I loves dogs" a single time, and then have it loop so it prints out 5 times. Its a time saver!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
  I am really stuck on this problem from the last exercise loops-arrays.js file...

  // YOU DO: Create an array of numbers and then iterate over that array to log double
  // of each of the number. (Ex: 4 doubled is 8.)

  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; {
  console.log(numbers * 2);
  }

  // YOU DO: Using the array of names below, print out "Happy Birthday <name>" for
  // each name except the first two.
  var names = ["Sevy", "Lindsey", "Jericho", "Raeonna", "Latrina", "Jhana", "Luca"];

  I need help on this!!
