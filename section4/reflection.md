## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

This week was a mess for me. I did not have enough time to even look at section 4 with my group as intended once I submitted my assesment, I was on such a good role, and then had to leave town for a few days and it completely disrupted my flow.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
I really enjoy using pom breaks and it does work when I have a consistent space to work in.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An object is a way to store more data using strings rther than index positions with using an array.  
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class: array
  * List of states and their capitals: Object
  * List of things to pack for vacation: array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow: array
  * List of student names and their cohort: object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake: object
  * All my favorite restaurants: array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

Something I did earlier today, booking a salt tank float. This website used keys to represent different properties such as identiy, time of float, prefered room, if your hair was dyed recently (boolean value).

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
I need more practice on this. I did not even finish the last exercise.
